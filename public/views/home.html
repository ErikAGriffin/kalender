      While it makes sense that a patient would not
      sign up on their own, perhaps I should not tie
      the creation of both family member and patient
      creation together in a single POST.
        - Need to flesh this out further, even for
        this first iteration. This is next.
        - After that UX is sorted, try to clean
        up all the methods. See below.

      The sign up process is currently messy. I do
      not like that a helper file must handle the
      dual creation.  Also there is no error handling
      for if a user patient is created but the
      patient patient fails.  I think I can achieve
      this through Transactions.

      I want the dual creation to occur from the model,
      if at all possible.

      The next thing to do is set up JWT and return a token to
      the family member that is logging in. I still don't like
      this current tied functionality, who approves patient?
      Should I focus on the bydel being essential? AKA you cannot
      have this app without being serviced by them?

      Before I do so however I shall begin unit testing in RSpec.
