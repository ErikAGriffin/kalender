      While it makes sense that a patient would not
      sign up on their own, perhaps I should not tie
      the creation of both family member and patient
      creation together in a single POST.

      Furthermore, I need to investigate if I can make
      the patient and family member primary key a foreign
      key to the users table.  Currently, when removing
      a patient from the database I would have to manually
      handle deletion of its user account.

      While there may be a use case for preserving user accounts,
      I do not see it. I think the design should be that removing
      a family member will remove the family member entry and its
      user entry at the same time.

      Removing a patient will remove the patient entry, its user
      entry, and all of the associated family member entries and their
      user accounts.

      Ahh but would you remove?  In the production product, we would
      want to make it as easy as possible for Users who discontinue the
      service to rejoin.
